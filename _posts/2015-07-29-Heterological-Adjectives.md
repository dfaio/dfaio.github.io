title: Heterological Adjectives

I stumbled across the following tidbit while reading Godel, Escher, Bach last night: heterological adjectives! It's a formulation of Russell's Paradox, but in the English language. 

Suppose I present you with the following two adjectives:

autological: an adjective that describes itself

heterological: an adjective that does not describe itself

For example, 'short' is an autological word, but 'long' is not. I think my favorite autological word (and these are the far rarer of the two) is 'attributive' - the word itself attributes meaning to it's modified noun.

And here's the brain-teaser of the day. What if we ask the following question: "Is 'heterological' heterological?"

If 'heterological' *is* itself heterological, then it certainly describes itself. But that would make 'heterological' autological. But we just said it was heterological!

If 'heterological' is *not* heterological, then it is autological (they're antoynms afterall). So then 'heterological' describes itself. So then 'heterological' is heterological. Contradiction!

So we wind up with the following: 'heterological' is heterological if and only if 'heterological' is not heterological.

Just a Wednesday morning's musings.
