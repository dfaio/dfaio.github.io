<p>As a nice first randomized algorithm, we’ll present a randomized version of quicksort and do some analysis on its runtime. This post assumes familiarity with basic probability concepts (mainly expectation).</p>

<p>This algorithm will be an example of Las Vegas algorithm - a randomized algorithm whose runtime is variable, not its probability of correctness. Interestingly, Las Vegas algorithms were first coined in 1979 by a professor at University of Chicago named Laszlo Babai. In fact, Babai’s doctoral advisor was Turan! (Of Turan’s theorem in graph theory).</p>

<p>Las Vegas algorithms are in contrast the other main type of randomized algorithm, Monte Carlo algorithms. Monte Carlo algorithms’ probability of correctness is variable, not their runtime.</p>

<p>But first, a lightning fast review of deterministic quicksort. In deterministic quicksort, we have some list that we want to sort. We pick a pivot point and then break our list up into two parts: those elements of the list smaller than the pivot and those greater. We then recurse on these smaller lists.</p>

<p>A quick python implementation is as follows:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">quicksort</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">L</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="n">pivot</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">L</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="n">smaller</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">elt</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">elt</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">L</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">elt</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">pivot</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="n">larger</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">elt</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">elt</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">L</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">elt</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">pivot</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">quicksort</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">smaller</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">pivot</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">quicksort</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">larger</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></div>

<p>On average, this will run in \(O(nlgn)\), but our worst-case runtime is \(O(n^2)\). That is, if our choice of pivot happens to be the smallest or biggest of the list, we’re kinda screwed.</p>

<p>So account for this issue, we can instead just choose a pivot at random. This can make it difficult for an adversary to feed us a worst case input. In python, this would amount to:</p>

<p>Quick and easy! Let’s do some analysis on the expected runtime. When we say expected runtime, we’re taking the expectation over all choices of random pivots for some fixed input.</p>

<p>We let \(a_1, a_1, \ldots a_n\) be some input to \(\texttt{randomized_quicksort}\) and let \(s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n\) be the sorted version of this input. We define indicator random variables \(X_{i,j}\) which are 1 if \(a_i\), \(a_j\) are ever compared during our given run of quicksort and 0 otherwise. By linearity:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\sum_{j = i+1}^n \mathbb{E}[X_{i, j}]</script>

<p>Since \(X_{i,j}\) is an indicator random variable, its expectation is just the probability that \(a_i\) and \(a_j\) are compared. So what is this probability? Let’s call the \(i\)th element of the (sorted) array \(e_i\) and the \(j\)th element of the array \(e_j\). Certainly, if we pick either one of those elements as a pivot, we’ll compare one to the other.</p>

<p>We’re picking pivots at random, so we might as well think of picking pivots in the following way: take the final sorted array and throw darts randomly at it. If the dart lands on the \(k\)th spot, use \(e_k\) as the pivot point. Somewhere in the sorted array, we have the sequence
<script type="math/tex">e_i, e_{i+1}, \ldots e_{j-1}, e_j</script>
If we pick a pivot outside of this chunk of the sorted array, we just throw another dart. If throw a pivot inside this chunk and it hits \(e_i\) or \(e_j\), the two get compared. But if we pick somewhere in the middle, \(e_i\) and \(e_j\) will get moved to seperate sublists and never be compared. So the probability that \(X_{i,j}\) is 1 is
<script type="math/tex">\frac{2}{j-i+1}</script>
So then we have that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\sum_{j = i+1}^n \mathbb{E}[X_{i, j}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\sum_{j = i+1}^n \frac{2}{j - i + 1}</script>

<p>Substituting in, we see this is equal to</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k}
\leq 2\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{k=2}^{n} \frac{1}{k}</script>

<p>Then, we have that the inside sum is less than \(lnn\). This can be seen by examining the integral of \(lnn\) and the viewing the sum as a Riemann sum underneath the curve. So then we have</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">2\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{k=2}^{n} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2\sum_{i=1}^{n} ln(n) \leq 2nln(n)</script>

<p>So then we have that our randomized quicksort algorithm runs in $O(nlgn)$ as desired. :)</p>
