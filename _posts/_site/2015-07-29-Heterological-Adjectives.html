<p>I stumbled across the following tidbit while reading Godel, Escher, Bach last night: heterological adjectives! It’s a formulation of Russell’s Paradox, but in the English language.</p>

<p>Suppose I present you with the following two adjectives:</p>

<p>autological: an adjective that describes itself</p>

<p>heterological: an adjective that does not describe itself</p>

<p>For example, ‘short’ is an autological word, but ‘long’ is not. I think my favorite autological word (and these are the far rarer of the two) is ‘attributive’ - the word itself attributes meaning to it’s modified noun.</p>

<p>And here’s the brain-teaser of the day. What if we ask the following question: “Is ‘heterological’ heterological?”</p>

<p>If ‘heterological’ <em>is</em> itself heterological, then it certainly describes itself. But that would make ‘heterological’ autological. But we just said it was heterological!</p>

<p>If ‘heterological’ is <em>not</em> heterological, then it is autological (they’re antonyms afterall). So then ‘heterological’ describes itself. So then ‘heterological’ is heterological. Contradiction!</p>

<p>So we wind up with the following: ‘heterological’ is heterological if and only if ‘heterological’ is not heterological.</p>

<p>Just a Wednesday morning’s musings.</p>
