<p>mpd (which stands for Music Player Daemon) is a commonly-used backend for playing music on Linux systems. I’ve been using it in conjunction with the ncmpcpp (ncurses-music-player-client-plus-plus) frontend for a while. It’s great for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>I’ve been looking for a way to emulate iTunes’s Recently Added playlists for a while and finally sat down to solve the problem.</p>

<p>mpd stores playlists as plain text, stored (on my system) in ~/.config/mpd/playlists as .m3u files. Since it’s plain text, we can simply redirect the output of some bash command to a new playlist file.</p>

<p>The command</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">find ~/Music -name <span class="s2">&quot;*.mp3&quot;</span> -mtime -30 <span class="p">|</span> sort</code></pre></div>

<p>does a nice approximation of the functionality for me. The -name flag followed by *.mp3 looks for mp3 files. The -mtime flag followed by -30 asks for files that have been modified in the last 30 days (note this can also mean getting added to the directory).</p>

<p>I chose to pipe this to sort, as I listen to music by album, and all my mp3 files start with their track number. So piping to sort sorts each album internally.</p>

<p>Feels like scratching a long-lasting itch :) This opens up a whole new world of “smart playlists!” You could write some giant, complicated python script, throw it on a cron job, and you have yourself a smart playlist :P</p>

<p>This is why I love mpd + ncmpcpp :)</p>
