<p>Some books I've read, enjoyed, and would recommend.</p>
<p><strong>Coders, the Making of a New Tribe.</strong></p>
<p>A book on programmer culture over the years. The author knows how to code some, but is not a programmer by trade. There's discussion programmer mental health, gender inequality, and social norms. The chapter 'The ENIAC girls' taught me that programming was originally a largely female profession. There is discussion of the bootcamp phenomenon.</p>
<p>The book made me think about the culture of the industry I work in. I recommended it.</p>
<p><strong>More Happy Than Not</strong></p>
<p>A queer love story with a surrealist twist. The first queer fiction I've sought out.</p>
<p><strong>Goodbye, Things</strong></p>
<p>One of my favorite books on minimalism. The author is open about his insecurities and the ways in which he would use things to compensate: abstruse books to seem literary, a big TV to seem like a film enthusiast.</p>
