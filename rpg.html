<p>
These are combined health / mana pools. Physical damage reduces your
might pool, some magical damage can reduce speed or intellect. Most
spells require spending intellect points. Many specialized physical
attacks require spending might or speed.
</p>

<p>
You can spend pool points to add any roll. At first level, you can
spend up to 3 pool points to add 3 to a single roll. This called using
<b>effort</b>.
</p>

<p>
Each of your pools has an associated <b>edge</b>. Edge reduces the cost of
<b>effort</b>. An edge of 1 decreases the cost of <b>effort</b> by one, an edge
of 2 decreases by 2, and so on.

<li><b>Sharpshooter</b>. Spend 1 speed to deal 1 extra damage with a ranged
weapon.</li>
<li><b>Overwatch</b>. You use a ranged weapon to target a narrow location
(e.g. a hallway or just above a rock etc.) and attack the first
creature that appears. This is a trigger action (occurs when someone
appears). This attack negates any advantage the creature would have
from cover or surprise (+3 and +6 to difficulty, respectively).</li>

You are a creature of pumice, not flesh. You can move, speak, and feel
pain. Your pumice body makes it harder to take damage, but also harder
to heal. You typically do not wear clothes, though your stone frame

Minor effect suggestion: you step on the target and prevent it from
moving next turn.  Major effect suggestion: you break a weapon,
shield, or piece of armor the target is using.

<p>
You gain +1 to armor, +1 might edge, and 5 additional might
points. You do not need to eat or drink or breathe (though you still
need to rest and sleep). You move more stiffly than a creature of
flesh, so can never be trained in speed defense rolls. You are
practiced as using your stone fists as a medium weapon.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga09f4cd">
<p>
Every roll has a difficulty, as determined by the GM. The player must
roll that difficulty or higher to succeed. Rolls typically have bonuses
applied to them.
</p>

<p>
Some examples of things that reduce difficulty include knowledge of a
situation, quality weapons or armor, training, an advantageous
situation, etc.
</p>

<p>
Players can spend pool points to lower difficulties.
</p>

<p>
Rolling a natural 19 or 20 (assuming the roll is a success against the
TD) introduces a <b>minor</b> or <b>major effect</b>, respectively.
</p>

<p>
Minor effects could be a particular grace to your action, or in
combat, an extra 3 damage, the opponent knocking the foe back,
distracting the foe, etc..
</p>

<p>
Major effects could be an extra 4 damage, knocking your foe down,
stunning them, etc. Alternatively, in combat, you may take another
action.

<h3 id="org6f25122">Attacking and defending</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6f25122">
<p>
Attacking an opponent is a roll, defending an attack is a
roll. The difficulty of these rolls is equal to the level of the opponent. For
instance, to hit or defend against a level 2 opponent requires a 6 or higher.
</p>

<p>
Damage and armor are flat numbers.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Light weapons</b> deal 2 damage and reduce TD by 1, as they're quick and easy to use.</li>
<li><b>Medium weapons</b> deal 4 damage.</li>
<li><b>Heavy weapons</b> require two hands and deal 6 damage.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Rolling a 17 deals an extra point of damage.
Rolling high can deal more damage.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>17 deals 1 additional damage.</li>
<li>18 deals 2 additional damage.</li>
<li>19 deals 3 additional damage or introduces a minor effect.</li>
<li>20 deals 4 additional damage or introduces a major effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Armor reduces damage by a flat amount, possibly down to zero.
</p>

<p>
Roll a 1 is bad as well and may introduce a GM complication. I'm not too
familiar on the rules of GM complications now, so we'll keep it simple and
forgiving for now :)

The first rest of the day takes an action (e.g. instead of attacking
