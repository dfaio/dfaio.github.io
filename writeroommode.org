Emacs writeroom mode is great. To install it, I needed to `package-refresh-contents`. `toggle-truncate-lines`, `toggle-word-wrap`, and `writeroom-mode` are the commands to enter into the ~ blissed out ~ minimal writing enviornment.

Now I have a very minimal looking writing enviornment that line wraps and centers text. I've missed writeroom since I left osx for linux in 2015 or so. Glad I finally set it up.
