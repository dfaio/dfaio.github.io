* More ramblings about modules, mostly to myself.
** 
* Old
The main goal here is to provide a slightly nicer.
** Signatures without structures are types.
  
signature NatSig:
        type nat
        val Z nat
        val S nat -> nat

is sugar for

type NatSig = some nat . (Z: nat * s: nat -> nat)

** Do Structures have an implicit signature?
Namely, their "everything is public signature".

struct Sg:
    type container = (nat * nat)
    val set = fn (x nat) container => (x, 0)
    val get = fn (x container) nat => fst(x)
    
could have this implicit signature

signature:
    type container
    val set nat -> container
    val get container -> nat
    
but it could also be

** Or are structures without signatures just named tuples with opaque types?
  
struct Sg:
    type container = (nat * nat)
    val set = fn (x nat) container => (x, 0)
    val get = fn (x container) nat => fst(x)
