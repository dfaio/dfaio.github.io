* An aeropress coffee recipe.
2021-02-11

Can be done inverted or with the Fellow coffee aeropress extension. If
using the extension, I prefer to put a paper filter in anyway, as
otherwise some grounds seep through.

1:15 ratio beans to water. Pour all the water in at once. Stir then
steep for a minute and a half. Then plunge for a minute. I use a
V60-appropriate grind setting.

Gets a nice cup with thick mouthfeel.

The long steep and the long plunge make for a cup in the middle of a
french press and pour over. Get both immersion and percolation, with
an extended percolation phase under a bit of pressure for that
distinctive aeropress twist.
