<h1 id="a-turing-machine-quine">A Turing Machine Quine</h1>
<p>2015-03-13</p>
<p>Today, we'll talk about something quite exciting. We define a Turing machine that prints its own source code. This construction offers us insight into how one may construct quines in any programming language.</p>
<p>First, some quick definitions. A <em>quine</em> is a program that prints itself. At first this may seem impossible! A first attempt in python may look something like</p>
<p>print &quot;print&quot;</p>
<p>But wait. We missed the first print. So perhaps we'll add another print? But then we have</p>
<p>print &quot;print 'print'&quot;</p>
<p>and we have the problem we started with. Let's revisit this is a moment.</p>
<p>A <em>Turing machine</em> is an abstraction of a computer. It has some finite number of states, transitions between those states, and infinite memory. Excitingly, this turns out to be a quite reasonable definition of computation. There's a very important result in computer science called the Church-Turing Thesis, which basically says that anything your-programming-language-here can do, so can a Turing machine.</p>
<p>Consequently, offering a Turing machine quine is a way of offering a quine for every programming language! We'll find that it's actually quite instructive to talk about quines in the abstract first, before moving into specific programming languages.</p>
<p>Right. So let's get started. We present the following lemma:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a computable function \(q\), where if \(w\) is some string, \(q(w)\) is a description of a Turing machine that prints out \(w\) and halts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We offer the following TM as a construction of this function:</p>
<p>Q = &quot;On input string w: 1. Construct the following TM P_w: P_w = 'On any input: 1. Erase the input 2. Write w to the tape 3. Halt' 2. return P_w&quot;</p>
<p>The distinction between \(q\) the function and Q the Turing machine can be a bit subtle. \(q\) is function that maps strings to Turing machines. Q (the Turing machine) is the result of applying \(q\) (the function) to \(w\). That is, Q = \(q(w)\).</p>
<p>So our TM Q takes a string w and outputs a TM that prints w. Perfect! Exactly what we wanted. Let's come back to this - we'll see why this is useful in a moment.</p>
<p>With this lemma in hand, we proceed to the main task: building a TM that prints itself. We'll split the machine up into two parts - A and B. First A will run, then B. Let's start with a description for A.</p>
<p>A's description depends on B, so let's assume we've written B. Remember the function \(q\) we just defined? We define A to be \(q(B)\). Which is to say, A is just a TM that, on any input, just prints a description of part B. This depends on our definition of B, so let's talk about that now.</p>
<p>B's the second and last part of the program, so at the end, we should have printed a full description of AB. By the time we get to B, A just ran, leaving a copy of B's source code sitting on the tape. Which means at this point, B has a description of itself. So then how do we get a description of A?</p>
<p>Here's the trick: we apply \(q\) to our description of B. By our definition, \(q(B)\) is a TM that, on any input, prints a copy of B. This was exactly our definition of part A! So B takes its own source code and applies \(q\) to it, obtaining a description of A. Then B outputs AB, completing the proof.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<p>QUINE = &quot;On input string w: 1. A = q(B) # A Turing machine that always prints B 2. B = 'On input M, where M is a part of a TM: 1. return q(M) + M'&quot;</p>
<p>Using this proof as a template, let's consider how we would write a quine in python. As before, let's consider part A first. Part A needs to give B a copy of B's source code. In the TM model, this was achieved by leaving a copy of B's description on the tape.</p>
<p>In python, we can just assign into a variable to achieve the same effect. So our part A should look something like</p>
<p>b = &quot;b's source code here&quot;</p>
<p>Part B should print part A and then print part B. Something like:</p>
<p>print &quot;b = %s&quot; % b # Print part A print b # Then print part B</p>
<p>Combining these two together (along with some careful tiptoe-ing around python formatting) yields:</p>
<p>b = 'print &quot;b = %r&quot; % b; print b' print &quot;b = %r&quot; % b; print b</p>
<p>And there you have it! A general guideline to make quines followed by an example. You are now equipped to go out and impress all your friends with your quine-making abilities. :P</p>
