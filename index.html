<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org04a56a5">
<p>
2015-10-20
</p>

<p>
This past summer, I bought a key-holding gadget. There´s two screws on
either end that pierce through the keys. The keys fold in on each
other. I'm a little paranoia about losing my keys, so I figured it'd
be a good way to make sure I don't lose any of them.
</p>

<p>
But god forbid you ever have to change what keys you carry with you.
</p>

<p>
I just bought a USB drive to put on it (I recently had a snafu with
arch and had to chroot in. But I had to go a couple hours without my
laptop because I didn't have a boot USB on me. Never again).
</p>

<p>
Anyway.
</p>

<p>
30 minutes into the process of rearranging my keys so that the USB
drive would fit on it, I thought to myself: "this has to be NP-hard."
</p>

<p>
And indeed it is.
</p>

<p>
We reduce from PARTITION. (Really, they're nearly the same
problem). Take a second and gaze at the key holder on the linked
amazon page to get a sense for the problem. We want to arrange the
keys so that all keys fit on the keyring and there's no "tangling" of
keys in the middle.
</p>

<p>
Call the length of the key holder \(l\).
</p>

<p>
Suppose I give you a bunch of keys to put on the key holder. Each key
is very short - maybe \(\frac{l}{3}\). So the length of the keys won't
be an issue - it's mostly an issue of getting the heights to
match. The keys are of varying heights.
</p>

<p>
Certainly, the key holder needs to have equal height on each
end. Additionally, every key must be present (like, why would you even
buy one of these things if you're still going to have keys jangling
around)?
</p>

<p>
So then, if the sum of the heights of the keys is \(S\), each side of
the key holder must have height \(\frac{S}{2}\).
</p>

<p>
But this is just exactly PARTITION, which we know to be NP-complete.
</p>

<p>
Sigh. Wikipedia says that there's a pseudo-poly time dynamic
programming solution for PARTITION, which has led PARTITION to be
called "The Easiest Hard Problem".
</p>

<p>
Though to be frank, I don't know if I consider that to be much
condolence.

<h2 id="org2e7c18a">Phone-a-Friend and SUPERHALTS</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2e7c18a">
<p>
2015-04-09
</p>

<p>
Deciding things is hard. There are countably many Turing machines, but
an uncountable number of decision problems! Sometimes, maybe asking
our TM M for a decision is unreasonable - maybe sometimes we should
let him phone-a-friend. A reasonable question to ask is: if our friend
always gives us the right answer, is this enough?
</p>

<p>
We define the phone-a-friend mechanism as follows: our TM M is given
access to an <b>oracle</b>. The TM may ask the oracle a membership
question: is this string \\(w\\) in some set \\(S\\)? The oracle is
all-knowing and will return a yes or no answer immediately. The oracle
will always answer correctly. We call a Turing machine with access to
an oracle an <b>oracle Turing machine</b>.
</p>

<p>
So certainly, all of a sudden, life gets a lot easier! For example,
solving HALTS is trivial! Just ask the oracle. But here's an
interesting question: is there a decision problem that a Turing
machine can't solve, even when given an oracle to HALTS? Which is to
say, is there a problem that our TM M's friend <b>can't</b> know?
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, (and maybe unsurprisingly), yes. Consider this
following problem, which we call \\(SUPERHALTS\\):
</p>

<p>
\\[ \\{(M, x) \| M\text{, with an oracle for the halting problem,
halts on x}\\} \\]
</p>

<p>
We can use the classic diagonalization argument to show that this is
undecidable. Suppose we have some oracle Turing machine \\(H\\) that
decides SUPERHALTS. Then we can define a new TM D to be:
</p>

<p>
D(X): If H(X, X) accepts with an oracle, then LOOP else ACCEPT
</p>

<p>
But then D(D) halts if and only if H(D, D) accepts. But H(D, D)
accepts iff D(D) loops! So we have that D(D) halts if and only if it
loops, a contradiction. Even if you've seen this argument before, take
a minute and reason through that last sentence. It's good for you.
</p>

<p>
So this is interesting. We've found a problem that's <b>harder than the
halting problem</b>. Significantly so. Which brings us to something
called <b>Turing degrees</b>. Computable functions have Turing
degree 1. Anything reducible to the halting problem has Turing
degree 2. The SUPERHALTS is our first problem with Turing greater than
two.
</p>

<p>
It's interesting how coarse a measurement Turing degree really
is. Obviously, it doesn't touch notions of complexity, with no regard
for the distinction between, say \(P\) and \(ELEMENTARY\). But
further, it doesn't even distinguish between Turing-decidable and
Turing-recognizable! (Or if you prefer, recursively enumerable). (A
Turing-recognizable set is similar to a decidable one, we just relax
the restriction that the TM must halt on all inputs).
</p>

<p>
So here's another question: is there any problem of intermediate
degree? Some problem that falls between HALTS and SUPERHALTS? This is
known as the <b>Post problem</b> (different from the Post Correspondence
Problem). And the answer, apparently, is yes.
</p>

<p>
The result involves something called a <b>priority ordering</b>. In a
priority ordering, we define some set \\(X\\). Then we make a
(potentially infinite) list of requirements. Each of these
requirements specifies whether or not some set of elements is in
\\(X\\). So we start with, say, the universe. Then requirement 1
specifies that elements in \\(X\\) must have some feature. And
requirement 2 does similarly. Maybe requirement \\(k\\) designates
that some element get thrown back into \\(X\\). And so on.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, this technique can be used to generate two problems A and B,
both of which can be solved with an oracle to the halting problem, but
neither can be solved with an oracle to the other! I guess you use the
priority ordering technique to forbid any Turing machine that would
reduce A to B or vice versa.
</p>

<p>
And into the world of non-computability we go! And you thought
complexity was bad&#x2026;

<h2 id="org661b957">A Turing Machine Quine</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org661b957">
<p>
2015-03-13
</p>

<p>
Today, we'll talk about something quite exciting. We define a Turing
machine that prints its own source code. This construction offers us
insight into how one may construct quines in any programming language.
</p>

<p>
First, some quick definitions. A <b>quine</b> is a program that prints
itself. At first this may seem impossible! A first attempt in python
may look something like
</p>

<p>
print "print"
</p>

<p>
But wait. We missed the first print. So perhaps we'll add another
print? But then we have
</p>

<p>
print "print 'print'"
</p>

<p>
and we have the problem we started with. Let's revisit this is a
moment.
</p>

<p>
A <b>Turing machine</b> is an abstraction of a computer. It has some finite
number of states, transitions between those states, and infinite
memory. Excitingly, this turns out to be a quite reasonable definition
of computation. There's a very important result in computer science
called the Church-Turing Thesis, which basically says that anything
your-programming-language-here can do, so can a Turing machine.
</p>

<p>
Consequently, offering a Turing machine quine is a way of offering a
quine for every programming language! We'll find that it's actually
quite instructive to talk about quines in the abstract first, before
moving into specific programming languages.
</p>

<p>
Right. So let's get started. We present the following lemma:
</p>

<p>
&gt; There is a computable function \\(q\\), where if \\(w\\) is some string, \\(q(w)\\) is a description of a Turing machine that prints out \\(w\\) and halts.
</p>

<p>
We offer the following TM as a construction of this function:
</p>

<p>
Q = "On input string w:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Construct the following TM P<sub>w</sub>:
P<sub>w</sub> = 'On any input:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Erase the input</li>
<li>Write w to the tape</li>
<li>Halt'</li>
</ol></li>
<li>return P<sub>w</sub>"</li>
</ol>

<p>
The distinction between \\(q\\) the function and Q the Turing machine
can be a bit subtle. \\(q\\) is function that maps strings to Turing
machines. Q (the Turing machine) is the result of applying \\(q\\)
(the function) to \\(w\\). That is, Q = \\(q(w)\\).
</p>

<p>
So our TM Q takes a string w and outputs a TM that prints w. Perfect!
Exactly what we wanted. Let's come back to this - we'll see why this
is useful in a moment.
</p>

<p>
With this lemma in hand, we proceed to the main task: building a TM
that prints itself. We'll split the machine up into two parts - A and
B. First A will run, then B. Let's start with a description for A.
</p>

<p>
A's description depends on B, so let's assume we've written
B. Remember the function \\(q\\) we just defined? We define A to be
\\(q(B)\\). Which is to say, A is just a TM that, on any input, just
prints a description of part B. This depends on our definition of B,
so let's talk about that now.
</p>

<p>
B's the second and last part of the program, so at the end, we should
have printed a full description of AB. By the time we get to B, A just
ran, leaving a copy of B's source code sitting on the tape. Which
means at this point, B has a description of itself. So then how do we
get a description of A?
</p>

<p>
Here's the trick: we apply \\(q\\) to our description of B. By our
definition, \\(q(B)\\) is a TM that, on any input, prints a copy of
B. This was exactly our definition of part A!  So B takes its own
source code and applies \\(q\\) to it, obtaining a description of
A. Then B outputs AB, completing the proof.
</p>

<p>
To summarize:
</p>

<p>
QUINE = "On input string w:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A = q(B) # A Turing machine that always prints B</li>
<li>B = 'On input M, where M is a part of a TM:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>return q(M) + M'"</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>
Using this proof as a template, let's consider how we would write a
quine in python. As before, let's consider part A first. Part A needs
to give B a copy of B's source code. In the TM model, this was
achieved by leaving a copy of B's description on the tape.
</p>

<p>
In python, we can just assign into a variable to achieve the same
effect. So our part A should look something like
</p>

<p>
b = "b's source code here"
</p>

<p>
Part B should print part A and then print part B. Something like:
</p>

<p>
print "b = %s" % b  # Print part A
print b             # Then print part B
</p>

<p>
Combining these two together (along with some careful tiptoe-ing
around python formatting) yields:
</p>

<p>
b = 'print "b = %r" % b; print b'
print "b = %r" % b; print b
</p>

<p>
And there you have it! A general guideline to make quines followed by
an example. You are now equipped to go out and impress all your
friends with your quine-making abilities. :P

The infinite complete &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;*ω*&lt;/span&gt;-nary tree is
one where every node has &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;ℕ&lt;/span&gt;-many
children. There are no leaves; the tree just extends downward

<p>
We can't BFS or DFS over &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;𝔊&lt;/span&gt;. A DFS would
simply get stuck on the leftmost branch forever and a BFS would never
reach depth 2. How then are we to traverse it?
</p>

<p>
In the infinite complete <b>binary</b> tree, nodes are uniquely indentified
by a finite length binary string. In &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;𝔊&lt;/span&gt;,
nodes are uniquely indentified by a finite sequence of natural numbers.
Let &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;*s*(<b>v</b>)&lt;/span&gt; be &lt;span
class="math inline"&gt;*v*&lt;/span&gt;'s corresponding sequence. In &lt;span
class="math inline"&gt;𝔊&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;*u*&lt;/span&gt; is
the parent of &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;*v*&lt;/span&gt; iff &lt;span
class="math inline"&gt;*s*(<b>u</b>)&lt;/span&gt;'s length is one less than &lt;span
class="math inline"&gt;*s*(<b>v</b>)&lt;/span&gt;'s' and &lt;span
class="math inline"&gt;*s*(<b>u</b>)&lt;/span&gt; is a prefix of &lt;span
class="math inline"&gt;*s*(<b>v</b>)&lt;/span&gt;.
</p>

<p>
Any tree traversal produces a well order on the tree's vertices. BFS on
the complete infinite binary tree is the shortlex ordering (sort first
by length, then lexographically). In fact, on level &lt;span
class="math inline"&gt;*i*&lt;/span&gt;, the set of corresponding binary strings
is the set of all &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;*i*&lt;/span&gt;-bit natural
numbers, and the nodes are visited in increasing order.
</p>

<p>
Further, any tree tree traversal has order type &lt;span
class="math inline"&gt;*ω*&lt;/span&gt;.
</p>

<p>
A traversal of &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;𝔊&lt;/span&gt; is a well order on the
nodes of &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;𝔊&lt;/span&gt;. What does this order look
like? Here's the idea (nodes are represented as int tuples):
</p>

<p>
{% highlight python %} def traverse(): visitedNextChild = {() : 0} while
True: currentlyVisited = visitedNextChild.keys() for v in
currentlyVisited: nextChild = v + (visitedNextChild\[v\],)
visit(nextChild) visitedNextChild\[v\] += 1
visitedNextChild\[nextChild\] = 0 {% endhighlight %} Here, We start with
the root node, which we can represent as the empty tuple. We maintain a
mapping from visited nodes to the next child of theirs to visit. At each
iteration, we visit each of the prescribed next children, and update the
mapping.
</p>

<p>
The fact that this visits every node in &lt;span
class="math inline"&gt;𝔊&lt;/span&gt; follows easily by induction.
</p>

<p>
In math symbols, if &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;*S*~*i*~&lt;/span&gt; is the set
of visited nodes at iteration &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;*i*&lt;/span&gt;, then
</p>

<p>
\
&lt;span class="math display"&gt;\\(\\) \\begin{align\*} S\<sub>i+1</sub> = S\<sub>i</sub> &amp;\&cup;
\\{s + 0 \\mid s \&isin; S\<sub>i</sub> \\} \\\\ &amp;\&cup; \\{s\<sub>1s</sub>\<sub>2\\ldots</sub>
(s\<sub>n</sub>+1)\\mid s\<sub>1s</sub>\<sub>2\\ldots</sub> s\<sub>n</sub> \&isin; S\<sub>i</sub> \\} \\end{align\*}
\$\$&lt;/span&gt;\
</p>

<p>
(there are totally duplicates being added here, but that's the beauty of
sets).
</p>

<p>
Fix the nodes &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;*u* = *s*~1~…*s*~*n* − 1~&lt;/span&gt;
and &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;*v* = *s*~1~…*s*~*n* − 1~*s*~*n*~&lt;/span&gt;.
Define &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;*t*(<b>x</b>)&lt;/span&gt; to be the iteration at
which &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;*x*&lt;/span&gt; is visited. Then &lt;span
class="math inline"&gt;*t*(<b>v</b>)=*t*(<b>u</b>)+*s*~*n*~ + 1&lt;/span&gt;. This leads to
this gorgeous fact:
</p>

<p>
&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;*s*~1~…*s*~*n*~&lt;/span&gt; is visited at iteration
&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\$\&sum;\<sub>i=1</sub>\<sup>n</sup> (s\<sub>i</sub> + 1) = n +
\&sum;\<sub>i=1</sub>\<sup>n</sup> s\<sub>i</sub>\$&lt;/span&gt;.
</p>

<p>
This means that our tree traversal has a pretty interesting
sub-relation: namely that &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;*u* &amp;lt; *v*&lt;/span&gt;
if &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;*u*&lt;/span&gt;'s length + &lt;span
class="math inline"&gt;*u*&lt;/span&gt;'s digit sum is less than &lt;span
class="math inline"&gt;*v*&lt;/span&gt;'s length + &lt;span
class="math inline"&gt;*v*&lt;/span&gt;'s digit sum. Or, (if we one-index), just
the digit sums.
</p>

<p>
From here on out, we'll one-index for simplicity's sake. (That is,
assume &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;ℕ&lt;/span&gt; starts at 1).
</p>

<p>
Let's see if we can characterize the entire ordering. (That is, instead
of building a relation based on iteration, build a relation built on
precise ordering of traversal).
</p>

<p>
It's exactly the same relation, but if they tied, you recurse on the
largest proper prefix of each.
</p>

<p>
{% highlight python %} def lessThan(u, v): \# u &amp;lt; v return
digitSum(u) &amp;lt; digitSum(v) or lessThan(u\[::-1\], v\[::-1\]) {%
endhighlight %}
</p>

<p>
So the empty sequence is the least element (as we visit the root of
&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;𝔊&lt;/span&gt; first). I'm fairly certain that if
you create the corresponding &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;≤&lt;/span&gt;
relation, this becomes a total order.
</p>

<p>
Here's the cool thing: we've produced an order on &lt;span
class="math inline"&gt;ℕ^\*^&lt;/span&gt; that has order type &lt;span
class="math inline"&gt;*ω*&lt;/span&gt;! (The normal shortlex trick doesn't work
when our alphabet is countably infinite).
</p>

<p>
In general, if we want to produce an ordering of order type &lt;span
class="math inline"&gt;*ω*&lt;/span&gt; on\
&lt;span class="math display"&gt;ℕ^\*^&lt;/span&gt;\
, it suffices to partition &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;ℕ^\*^&lt;/span&gt; into
countably many partitions, each of finite size. Then the
"concatentation" of these partitions yields order type &lt;span
class="math inline"&gt;*ω*&lt;/span&gt;.
</p>

<p>
Just some fun observations :)

Study what you want to know. Do you want to pass standardized exams?
If so, study those vocab lists. Do you want to read a book? If so,
collect a list of the most frequently used words in the book and study
those.
</p>

<p>
Collecting vocab from books.
</p>

<p>
Open a txt file of the book you want to read in
ChineseTextAnalyzer. For popular books, googling the Chinese title and
´mobi´ or ´txt´ usually turns up a copy of the book. will
</p>

<p>
ChineseTextAnalyzer splits the file up into words (presumably with
longest-match against CC-CEDICT). Based on a set of 'known words,'
ChineseTextAnalyzer can give you a list of unknown words, sorted by
frequency of appearance in the text. It's then super easy to export
these words into a CSV file and import into Anki.
</p>

<p>
I find this method of gathering vocab to be much more motivating that
studying lists of words from a textbook. This way, I get longer-form
reading with content I'm interested in, and a vocab list
custom-tailored to the content I want to consume.
</p>

<p>
(Shout out to the incredible 书博 for telling me about this one).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb4b2535">
<p>
I consider highlight-on-lookup an essential feature for reading 'real'
Chinese long-form material. I don't have the patience to handwrite
characters into Pleco every time I don't understand what's going
on. Finding a good mobi file for the English-Chinese dictionary
CC-CEDICT does wonders.
</p>

<p>
I put this file in the documents/dictionaries directory on my Kindle;
it might be different for your e-reader. If your e-reader doesn't
support mobi, I suggest the wonderful tool ebook-convert as a means to
convert it to epub.
</p>

<p>
This isn't a perfect solution; CC-CEDICT is probably my least favorite
English-Chinese dictionary around, but I have been unable to find any
other dictionaries in electronic form. The Kindle has a
English-Chinese dictionary by default, but for baffling reasons, it
does not include pinyin.

<b>Coders, the Making of a New Tribe.</b>
</p>

<p>
A book on programmer culture over the years. The author knows how to code some, but is not a programmer by trade. There's discussion programmer mental health, gender inequality, and social norms. The chapter 'The ENIAC girls' taught me that programming was originally a largely female profession. There is discussion of the bootcamp phenomenon.
</p>

<p>
The book made me think about the culture of the industry I work in. I
recommended it.

<b>More Happy Than Not</b>
</p>

<p>
A queer love story with a surrealist twist. The first queer fiction
I've sought out.
</p>

<p>
<b>Goodbye, Things</b>
</p>

<p>
One of my favorite books on minimalism. The author is open about his
insecurities and the ways in which he would use things to compensate:
abstruse books to seem literary, a big TV to seem like a film
enthusiast.

I've made this well over 10 times, maybe 20. Not a lifetime of
refinement, but enough to have a couple details I try to include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Let the rice sit on the pan for a while so it gets real crispy.</li>
<li>Fry the egg whites separately from the yolk for varied texture and color.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Couple different flavor profiles:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Fish sauce (tablespoon per block of tofu), light rice vinegar,
cilantro, mint, jalapenos (and fermented jalapeno sauce), crab,
kumquats.</li>
<li>Soy sauce, dark rice vinegar, shaoxing rice wine, chili oil.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I usually just fry up a block of tofu and stick it in with the veggies.
</p>

<p>
Tips to prep before:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Chooped boy choy and carrots keep nicely in the fridge.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Haven't found a tofu marinade I like much. It seems to make it wetter,
which prevents it from getting crispy in the frier.
