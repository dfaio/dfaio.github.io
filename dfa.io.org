A review / discussion of the book Coders, the Making of a New Tribe. 

A breezy read that focuses on programmer culture over the years. The
chapter 'The ENIAC Girls' details how programming was originally a
largely female industry (which I did not realize). Let's make CS-land
less of a dude-fest. When I graduated from CMU, half of the incoming
freshman class was female. The mid-stage, systems-focused startup I
work at has maybe 5ish female engineers on a team of 40ish. It seemed
to me in school that the systems classes were fairly male. I wonder
why.

Toward the end of the book, Coders turns its attention to the recent
bootcamp phenomenon. There's a line in the book, something to the
effect of "Think miners can't learn javascript? Think again." It is an
unusual industry, programming. Self-taught folks working alongside
PhD's. This chapter really reinforced for me that pedigree is not
especially correlated with programming competency. I wonder what
percentage of programming jobs are Silicon Valley programming jobs.

The book made me think about the culture of the industry I work in. I
recommended it.
