<h2 id="fried-rice">Fried rice</h2>
<p>I've made this well over 10 times, maybe 20. Not a lifetime of refinement, but enough to have a couple details I try to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let the rice sit on the pan for a while so it gets real crispy.</li>
<li>Fry the egg whites separately from the yolk for varied texture and color.</li>
</ul>
<p>Couple different flavor profiles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fish sauce (tablespoon per block of tofu), light rice vinegar, cilantro, mint, jalapenos (and fermented jalapeno sauce), crab, kumquats.</li>
<li>Soy sauce, dark rice vinegar, shaoxing rice wine, chili oil.</li>
</ul>
<p>I usually just fry up a block of tofu and stick it in with the veggies.</p>
<p>Tips to prep before:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chooped boy choy and carrots keep nicely in the fridge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Haven't found a tofu marinade I like much. It seems to make it wetter, which prevents it from getting crispy in the frier.</p>
<h2 id="bread">Bread</h2>
<p>I've made the Joy of Cooking white bread recipe several times and have enjoyed it. It toasts up well nicely on a cast iron pan, as well.</p>
<h2 id="cinnamon-garlic-ginger-garbonzo-bean-soup">Cinnamon-garlic-ginger garbonzo bean soup</h2>
<p>Amanda's always been the one to make this, I can't claim to know how to make it offhand. That's a TODO haha.</p>
<h2 id="slow-cooked-pork">Slow cooked pork</h2>
<p>Cut pork shoulder into about 3x3x3 inch blocks. Place in slow cooker with a half cup water and a half teaspoon salt for each pound of meat. Cook on low for 8 hours. Fries up nicely.</p>
<p>Keeps in the fridge for a couple days, I didn't get sick eating it 3 days later (having cooked it on the sell-by date).</p>
<h2 id="larder">Larder</h2>
<h3 id="lacto-fermented-hot-sauces">Lacto-fermented hot sauces</h3>
<p>I've tried this with jalapenos and have some poblanos and serranos going at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Stem and seed about a pount of peppers. Puree. Add salt (0.075 x the weight of pepper puree). Stir. Place in big mason jar, wait 4 weeks.</p>
<p>Be sure the peppers are totally covered by the brine. Feel free to add more brine if needed (not sure how the added brine strategy plays out, that's still a WIP).</p>
<p>At the end of the 4 weeks, place the pepper puree in some vinegar (TODO how much?) and briefly boil. Keeps in the fridge for about 6 months, apparently.</p>
<h3 id="chili-oil">Chili Oil</h3>
<p>Still new to me, on my second try.</p>
<ul>
<li>Canola Oil (obv not ideal)</li>
<li>Chinese dried peppers (not sure on the details)</li>
<li>Sichuan peppercorns, toasted and ground</li>
<li>Anise, toasted and ground.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some tweaks and things to try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a peanut oil of Chinese manufacture.</li>
<li>Experiment with different dried peppers</li>
<li>This second time I tried soaking the peppers in water after toasting, as if I was making mole. I also chopped the peppers into small rings.</li>
<li>More "five spices" - fennel, cloves, and (cassia?) cinnamon.</li>
<li>Fried soybeans</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="salsas">Salsas</h3>
<p>My fave is wrapping garlic, tomatillos, and serranos in some foil and heating in a pan for maybe 20-30 mins, then puree-ing with some salt and lime.</p>
