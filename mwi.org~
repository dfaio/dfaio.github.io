* Mwi is a small town

No more than a dozen wood buildings centered around a single road in
and out of town, running east-to-west. You notice a number sunbleached
wagons stationed surrounding the building.

Sheriff Horace Moorhead asks for the marked to travel to the
canyons. He has a goatee. Word from the east has rumour of a stone of
purple flame, the Mayor from the blue.
