* Arranging keys on my key holder is NP-hard

2015-10-20

This past summer, I bought a key-holding gadget. ThereÂ´s two screws on
either end that pierce through the keys. The keys fold in on each
other. I'm a little paranoia about losing my keys, so I figured it'd
be a good way to make sure I don't lose any of them.

But god forbid you ever have to change what keys you carry with you.

I just bought a USB drive to put on it (I recently had a snafu with
arch and had to chroot in. But I had to go a couple hours without my
laptop because I didn't have a boot USB on me. Never again).

Anyway.

30 minutes into the process of rearranging my keys so that the USB
drive would fit on it, I thought to myself: "this has to be NP-hard."

And indeed it is.

We reduce from PARTITION. (Really, they're nearly the same
problem). Take a second and gaze at the key holder on the linked
amazon page to get a sense for the problem. We want to arrange the
keys so that all keys fit on the keyring and there's no "tangling" of
keys in the middle.

Suppose I give you a bunch of keys to put on the key holder. Each key
is very short - maybe l/3. So the length of the keys won't
be an issue - it's mostly an issue of getting the heights to
match. The keys are of varying heights.

Certainly, the key holder needs to have equal height on each
end. Additionally, every key must be present (like, why would you even
buy one of these things if you're still going to have keys jangling
around)?

Call the length of the key holder l.

So then, if the sum of the heights of the keys is S, each side of
the key holder must have height S/2.

But this is just exactly PARTITION, which we know to be NP-complete.

Sigh. Wikipedia says that there's a pseudo-poly time dynamic
programming solution for PARTITION, which has led PARTITION to be
called "The Easiest Hard Problem".

Though to be frank, I don't know if I consider that to be much
condolence.
