* Traversing the Infinite Complete ω-nary Tree

2016-03-03

The infinite complete ω-nary tree is
one where every node has ℕ-many
children. There are no leaves; the tree just extends downward
infinitely. Call this graph 𝔊.

We can't BFS or DFS over 𝔊. A DFS would simply get stuck on the
leftmost branch forever and a BFS would never reach depth 2. How then
are we to traverse it?

In the infinite complete *binary* tree, nodes are uniquely indentified
by a finite length binary string. In 𝔊, nodes are uniquely indentified
by a finite sequence of natural numbers. Let *s(v)* be *v*'s
corresponding sequence. In 𝔊, *u* is the parent of *v* iff *s(u)*'s
length is one less than *s(v)*'s and *s(u)* is a prefix of
*s(v)*.

Any tree traversal produces a well order on the tree's vertices. BFS
on the complete infinite binary tree is the shortlex ordering (sort
first by length, then lexographically). In fact, on level *i*, the set
of corresponding binary strings is the set of all *i*-bit natural
numbers, and the nodes are visited in increasing order.

Further, any tree tree traversal has order type *ω*.

A traversal of 𝔊 is a well order on the
nodes of 𝔊. What does this order look
like? Here's the idea (nodes are represented as int tuples):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
def traverse():
    visitedNextChild = {() : 0}
    while True:
        currentlyVisited = visitedNextChild.keys()
        for v in currentlyVisited:
            nextChild = v + (visitedNextChild[v],)
            visit(nextChild) visitedNextChild[v] += 1
            visitedNextChild[nextChild] = 0
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here, We start with the root node, which we can represent as the empty
tuple. We maintain a mapping from visited nodes to the next child of
theirs to visit. At each iteration, we visit each of the prescribed
next children, and update the mapping.

The fact that this visits every node in 𝔊 follows by induction.
In math symbols, if S_i is the set of visited nodes at iteration i, then

S_{i+1} = S_i ∪ {s + 0 | s in S_i} ∪ {s_1 s_2 ... s_{n+1} | s_1 s_2... s_n in S_i}

(there are totally duplicates being added here, but that's the beauty of
sets).

Fix the nodes u = s~1~…*s*~*n* − 1~ and v = *s*~1~…*s*~*n* − 1~*s*~*n*~.
Define t(x) to be the iteration at which x is visited. Then t(v)=t(u)+s~n~ + 1. This leads to
this gorgeous fact:

*s*~1~…*s*~*n*~ is visited at iteration \$\\sum\_{i=1}\^n (s\_i + 1) = n + \\sum\_{i=1}\^n s\_i\$.

This means that our tree traversal has a pretty interesting
sub-relation: namely that *u*; *v* if *u*'s length + *u*'s digit
sum is less than *v*'s length + *v*'s digit sum. Or, (if we
one-index), just the digit sums.

From here on out, we'll one-index for simplicity's sake. (That is,
assume ℕ starts at 1).

Let's see if we can characterize the entire ordering. (That is, instead
of building a relation based on iteration, build a relation built on
precise ordering of traversal).

It's exactly the same relation, but if they tied, you recurse on the
largest proper prefix of each.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
def lessThan(u, v):
    return digitSum(u) &lt; digitSum(v) or lessThan(u\[::-1\], v\[::-1\]) {%
endhighlight %}
#+END_EXAMPLE

So the empty sequence is the least element (as we visit the root of 𝔊
first). I'm fairly certain that if you create the corresponding ≤
relation, this becomes a total order.

Here's the cool thing: we've produced an order on 
ℕ^\* that has order type *ω*! (The normal shortlex trick doesn't work
when our alphabet is countably infinite).

In general, if we want to produce an ordering of order type ω on ℕ^\*,
it suffices to partition ℕ^\*^ into countably many partitions, each of
finite size. Then the "concatentation" of these partitions yields
order type ω.

Just some fun observations :)
