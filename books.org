Some books I've read, enjoyed, and would recommend.

*Coders, the Making of a New Tribe.*

A book on programmer culture over the years. The author knows how to
code some, but is not a programmer by trade. There's discussion
programmer mental health, gender inequality, and social norms. The
chapter 'The ENIAC girls' taught me that programming was originally a
largely female profession. There is discussion of the bootcamp
phenomenon.

The book made me think about the culture of the industry I work in. I
recommended it.

*More Happy Than Not*

A queer love story with a surrealist twist. The first queer fiction
I've sought out.

*Goodbye, Things*

One of my favorite books on minimalism. The author is open about his
insecurities and the ways in which he would use things to compensate:
abstruse books to seem literary, a big TV to seem like a film
enthusiast.
